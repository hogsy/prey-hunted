PREY: Hunted v0.0.1
	Mark "hogsy" Sowden (hogsy@oldtimes-software.com)
----------------------------------------------

I've wanted to make a modification to Prey for
a very long time now, and finally managed to
find the time to do so.

Right now it's just a small set of changes, 
nothing huge, but I hope it will make the
game experience a little different.

In the future I'd like to do a heck of a lot
more, but we'll see :)

Features:
	- Death walk has been removed, so dying now means you will need to load via save or restart
	- CVar "pm_modelView" now works, so you can view the world from Tommy's eyes!
	- CVar "pm_modelViewForward" has been added so you can adjust the camera with pm_modelView enabled
	- WIP '98 HUD recreation (to enable it, move hud/dev/hud_healthbars.guifragment into hud/)
